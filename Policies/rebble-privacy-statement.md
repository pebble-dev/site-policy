### Rebble Privacy Statement

### What information Rebble collects and why

#### Information from website browsers

If you're **just browsing the website**, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

##### Why we collect this information

We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use Rebble, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.

#### Information from users with accounts

If you **create an account**, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You may also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."

"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.

##### Why we collect this information

- We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide the Rebble service, the Appstore service, or to respond to support requests.
- We may use your User Personal Information to identify you on Rebble.
- We may use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.
- We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. Please see our section on [email communication](#how-we-and-others-communicate-with-you) for more information.
- We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest apps you may want to view or download. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on Rebble, such as the apps you like — to determine your interests, and we recommend similar content. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.
- We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation.
- We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.

##### Our legal basis for processing information

Under certain international laws (including GDPR), Rebble is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. Rebble processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:

- When you create a Rebble account, you provide your account and email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your account and email address on other bases. If you have a paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. Rebble does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.
- When you fill out the information in your user profile, you may have the option to provide User Personal Information. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time.
- Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access Rebble, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.
- If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please contact us.

### What information Rebble does not collect

We do not intentionally collect **sensitive personal information**, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Rebble does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

If you're a **child under the age of 13**, you may not have an account on Rebble. Rebble does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Please see our [Terms of Service](/tos) for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Rebble without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.

We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your appstore listings or other free-form content inputs. Information relating to your apps belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our [Terms of Service](/tos). Any personal information within a user's content is the responsibility of the content owner.

#### Apps and appstore listing contents

Rebble officers, employees, agents or representatives do not access private app store listings unless required to for security reasons, to assist the owner with a support matter, or to maintain the integrity of the service.

If your appstore listing is public, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public app listing, such as email addresses or passwords, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content within your apps, we may scan our servers for certain security signatures, or for known active malware.

Please see more about [User Personal Information in public content](#public-information-on-rebble).

### How we share the information we collect

We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, we may share your location with a weather service to provide you with relevant weather information. Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on Rebble, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you publish an public application. We will respect your choices.

We **do not** share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to.

We **do not** host advertising on Rebble. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. Any advertisements within user content or in appstore listings are not sponsored by, or tracked by, Rebble.

We **do not** disclose User Personal Information outside Rebble, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on [Compelled Disclosure](#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure).

We **do** share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Rebble, or how our users respond to our other offerings. For example, we may compile statistics on appstore usage. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.

We **do** share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, network data transmission, and other similar services. Our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our third party vendors are, please contact us.

We do share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties. For example, we share the number of likes on an app, or in the event of a security incident, we may share the number of times a particular file was accessed.

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.

#### Public information on Rebble

Much of Rebble is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your app or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Rebble information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape Rebble and compile data as well.

Your Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Rebble data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of Rebble data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available.

If you would like to compile Rebble data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding [scraping](/tos/#5-scraping) and [privacy](/tos/#6-privacy), and you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a Rebble user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Rebble, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Rebble or Rebble users.

Similarly, projects on Rebble may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a Rebble project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to Rebble users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal Information on Rebble, please see our section on [resolving complaints](#resolving-complaints).

#### Third party applications

You have the option of enabling or adding third party applications to your account. These applications are not necessary for your use of Rebble. We will share your User Personal Information to third parties when you ask us to, however, you are responsible for your use of the third party application and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it.

#### Rebble applications

You may also have the option of adding applications from Rebble to your account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all Rebble applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we will always collect the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.

### How you can access and control the information we collect

If you're already a Rebble user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your user profile information by contacting us.

#### Data retention and deletion of data

Generally, Rebble will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so by contacting us. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Our use of cookies and tracking

#### Cookies

Rebble uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Rebble. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use Rebble’s services.

#### Tracking and analytics

We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users' use of Rebble; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.

### How Rebble secures your information

Rebble takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.

In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Rebble's global privacy practices

We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.

In particular:
-	We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
-	We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.
-	We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.

### How we respond to compelled disclosure

Rebble may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Rebble strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.

### How we, and others, communicate with you

We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. For example, if you contact us with a request, we will respond to you via email.

Depending on your email settings, Rebble may occasionally send notification emails new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent, if you opt in to our list. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as system emails.

Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.

### Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about the way Rebble is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may email us directly at privacy@rebble.io with the subject line "Privacy Concerns."
